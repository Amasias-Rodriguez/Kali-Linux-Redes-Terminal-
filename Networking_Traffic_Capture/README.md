-Detect Telnet traffic and plaintext credentials.
# Capture [telnet.png]
- Connecting the attacking vm to Metasploit using Telnet command.
- Remote access with Telnet. 
# Capture [credentials-cap]
- Capturing credentials with tcpdump command.
- Identifying sensitive traffic without encryption.
# Capture [wireshark.png]
- Credentials capture with Wireshark.
# Capture [wire1.png] [wire2.png]
- Using wireshark > Follow TCP to find login and password credentials.
